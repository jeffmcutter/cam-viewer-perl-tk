# cam-viewer-perl-tk
For viewing images collected with time stamps.

I wrote this quite a while back to view images collected from my IP cameras one after another and enable me to save and archive them.

This one is as the name indicates in Perl Tk, I have since rewritten it in Python Tk which I will call cam-viewer-python-tk.
